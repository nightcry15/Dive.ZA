      <h2>The Unique Waters of the Wester Cape</h2>
      <p class="cape-diving">The diving in Western Cape is some of the most exciting in the world. It certainly is one
        of the top 5 places to cage dive with great white sharks, but the underwater environment
        also offers much more than tremendous sharks. Western Cape’s diving can generally be
        divided into three major areas: False Bay, the south coast and the Atlantic seaboard.
        <br><br>Most of the dive sites in Western Cape are clustered around the Cape of Good Hope
        on the Atlantic coast and in False Bay. Here divers will find four distinct habitats,
        namely rocky shores, reefs, kelp forests and sandy bottoms. There are also a myriad of
        wrecks on both sides of the peninsula. You can expect colder waters and heavier currents
        on the western side which hosts a relatively small shelf before dropping into extremely
        deep waters. In False Bay to the east, current is minimal and the waters are warmer,
        attracting many species. Divers may also wish to take a cage diving trip to Seal Island
        while staying in Western Cape.<br><br>Outside of False Bay, the southern coast of Western
        Cape has a few other protected areas in which divers enjoy exploring colorful reefs.
        These sites offer a variety of conditions and include locales such as Mossel Bay, Knysna,
        and Hermanus. Mossel Bay also has great white shark cave diving that is closer to shore
        and less crowded than that of False Bay. For divers looking for a scuba adventure without
        the risk of the open ocean, Cape Town boasts the Two Oceans Aquarium. A dive into the
        Predator Exhibit will allow you to get close to sharks, turtles and pelagic species in
        a controlled and safe environment.<br><br>Scuba diving in the Western Cape province of
        South Africa is possible year-round. The area generally has a Mediterranean climate with
        hot summers and rainy winters. Expect cooler temperatures during the winter season
        (June-August). However, the southern coast is much calmer and more accessible during
        these cooler months. On the other hand, the Atlantic coast becomes inaccessible during
        the winter months. As a rule of thumb, the season in which you visit will determine where
        you dive. Water temperatures average between 13 and 17°C. If you are looking
        for a thrill and the possibility of seeing something big, then diving in Western Cape is
        the right choice for you.</p>

        <div class="column-3"><h3>Sharks</h3>Cape Town is the only place in the world where you can
          consistently dive with Seven Gill Cow Sharks.Encounter prehistoric looking seven
          gill cow sharks in the kelp forests of False Bay, just off Miller's Point. Guided dives
          offer an 85% chance of successfully spotting these predators all year round, in a 12m deep
          channel with a sandy bottom. Catsharks and spotted gully sharks are also seen at this dive
          site, along with other marine life.</div>
        <div class="column-blank"><br></div>
        <div class="column-3"><h3>Seals</h3>Scuba diving with seals in Cape Town is a must for every
          scuba enthusiast. Explore the kelp forests around Duiker Island, Partridge Point and
          Strawberry Rock and be entertained by these beautiful creatures. Unlike when they are
          above water, where they are slow and awkward, seals are amazingly agile under the water.
          They live in closely knit colonies and it often happens that when we go scuba diving near
          them that we encounter dozens of them underwater at the same time.<br>They are playful and
          curious creatures and are also known as the clowns of Cape Town. They love to swim around
          scuba divers and are bound to make your dive experience a memorable one.</div>
        <div class="column-blank"><br></div>
        <div class="column-3"><h3>Shipwrecks</h3>The Cape waters are littered with thousands of
          shipwrecks, recent and ancient, on the shore and in deep water. Common wreck dives are
          the Maori, the Astor, the Katzu Maru, the Smitswinkel Bay wrecks (of which there are five)
          and the SAS Pietermaritzburg. The commonly dived wrecks vary in depth and can range
          between 12m to 40m. We can take you to several wrecks and will pick them depending on
          your dive qualification.</div>

        <div class="column-2"><h2>Wreck & Reef - From R2,100.00</h2><h3 id="left">Wreck</h3> The Cape Point has been nicknamed the Cape of Storms
          for good reason. It has become notorious for the winter storms that have sent many a sea vessel to
          spend the remainder of its days in the depths of the South African waters. This has allowed for some
          spectacular wreck diving in the Cape.<br><br>The Cape has a wreck for every level of experience and qualification,
          from simple shore entry shallow wrecks, to deeper wrecks only accessible by boat. If you enjoy the thrill of stepping
          back in time or simply enjoy visiting some of the most historic underwater locations, then this is the package for
          you!<br><br><b>Some common wrecks to dive include:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>SS Maori</li>
            <li>MV Aster</li>
            <li>Smitswinkel Bay wrecks (the are 5 to choose from)</li>
            <li>SAS Pietermaritzburg</li>
            <li>SS Clan Stuart</li>
          </ul>
          The depths of the wrecks range from 12m to 40m and will be chosen based on your qualifications and experience,
          followed by water conditions on the day.<br><br>
          <hr>
          <h3 id="left">Reef</h3>
          Paired along side this are some of the the most specatacular deep water reefs and shallower kelp forests around.
          False Bay has been recognised as biodiversity hotspot due to the large number of endemic animals that live in our
          waters.<br><br>Our deeper reefs play home to a number of sea fans and whips, reef fish, sharks, octopi, nudibranches,
          crabs, sponges and cold water corals. As such, our reefs lie at depths ranging from 30m to 10m, giving the opportunity for
          both open water and advanced divers to enjoy their beauty.
