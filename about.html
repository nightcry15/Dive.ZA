      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>G'day, my name is Alexander, but you can call me Alex!<br>I have been qualified as a PADI Pro
        since November 2017 and qualified as an Open Water Scuba Instructor in October of 2018.<br><br>I have
        have been diving in the cape waters since 2014 when I completed my open water course with the Maties
        Underwater Club in Stellebosch. Since then, I have spent every moment that I can spare in the water!

          How Scuba Diving Can Make You Feel Great!
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <section class="section section-light">
      <div class="row">
        <div>Sometimes, we all just need a good ‘pick-me-up’. Here are just a few ways in
          which scuba diving can deliver the antidote to life’s ups and downs and help
          you feel great about yourself again.</div>
        <div class="column-3"><h3>Relaxation</h3>Assuming you’re not jumping into the sardine run for a thrill-seeking challenge,
          the underwater world has a wonderfully calming effect on the mind. For many
          divers, the ocean is a go-to destination for escaping the hustle and bustle of
          everyday life . It’s a soothing place where buzzing phones, over-flowing in-trays
          and domestic worries feel a million miles away as your mind focuses on marine
          life, corals and colours. If you want to take your inner peace to the next level,
          try giving underwater meditation a go on your next dive.</div>

        <div class="column-3"><h3>Healing</h3>Scuba diving is not just a way to relax after a busy week – it can promote wellbeing
          on a much deeper level – physically and mentally. PADI AmbassaDiver Gary Green overcame
          Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder after discovering the underwater world. P.T. Hirschfield,
          who was diagnosed with terminal cancer three years ago, talks about how scuba diving
          makes her feel alive, “Scuba gave me the incentive to get well—the idea of getting
          underwater motivated me not to give up, lie in a corner and die, as they said I might.”</div>

        <div class="column-3"><h3>Reward</h3>As those who have progressed their diving to professional ratings will know,
          it’s incredibly satisfying to teach other people to dive. The look on a student’s
          face when they first descend, spot their first turtle, or finally nail that buoyancy
          control is priceless. All PADI® Pros know the feel-good factor that comes with
          helping someone overcome their fear, or setting them off on their career path.
          Becoming a PADI Instructor can bring massive reward for divers who want to give back
          to a sport they’re passionate about.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column-3"><h3>Purpose</h3>If you pair up your diving skills with a higher purpose (like cleaning up marine
          debris, or rescuing marine life) then you’ll know that you are helping to protect
          the ocean for generations to come. Not only is that an awesome thing to do for planet
          Earth, it’s undoubtedly going to make you feel great about yourself, too.</div>

        <div class="column-3"><h3>Connection</h3>From joining up with your buddy and sharing dive stories with the other guests,
          to impressing non-divers with your exciting tales from the ocean, scuba diving is
           a sure-fire way to explore common interests and forge connections with those
           around you.</div>

        <div class="column-3"><h3>Education</h3>Every time we kit up and jump into the water, we’re learning – and not just when we
          complete our PADI courses. Every minute spent below the waves is an opportunity to
          discover new marine life, explore new wrecks, hone our photography skills – or even
          soak up inspiration and advice from your buddy. By learning, we’re stretching and
          enriching our minds – and that’s a fast-track way to feeling on top of the world.</div>
