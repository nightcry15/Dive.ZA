        <div class="column-3"><h3>Open Water</h3>If you’ve always wanted to take scuba diving lessons, experience
        unparalleled adventure and see the world beneath the waves, this is where it starts. Get your scuba
        diving certification with the PADI Open Water Diver course – the world’s most popular and widely
        recognized scuba course. Millions of people have learned to scuba dive and gone on to discover the
        wonders of the aquatic world through this course.<br><br>To enroll in a PADI Open Water Diver course
        (or Junior Open Water Diver course), you must be 10 years old or older. You need adequate swimming
        skills and need to be in good physical health. No prior experience with scuba diving is required.
        <h2>R5,600.00</h2></div>

        <div class="column-3"><h3>Advanced Open Water</h3>That’s what the PADI Advanced Open Water Diver course
          is all about. You don’t have to be “advanced” to take it – it’s designed to advance your diving, so
          you can start right after earning your PADI Open Water Diver certification. The course helps build
          confidence and expand your scuba skills through different Adventure Dives. You try out different
          specialties while gaining experience under the supervision of your PADI Instructor. You log dives and
          develop capabilities as you find new ways to have fun scuba diving.<h2>R5,600.00</h2>
          <h2>R6,200.00 - including nitrox certification</h2></div>

        <div class="column-3"><h3>Rescue</h3>Scuba divers describe the PADI Rescue Diver course as the most
          challenging, yet most rewarding course they’ve ever taken. Why? Because you learn to prevent and
          manage problems in the water, and become more confident in your skills as a diver, knowing that you
          can help others if needed. During the course, you learn to become a better buddy by practicing problem
          solving skills until they become second nature. Plus, the course is just fun – it’s serious, but still
          allows for lots of laughter in between the focused learning.<h2>R4,000.00</h2></div>

      <h2>PADI Speciality Courses</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column-3"><h3>Gas Blender</h3>The PADI Enriched Air Diver course is the most popular diver
          specialty course and the number of technical divers is on the rise, which means that lots of scuba
          divers want enriched air and gas blends. The Tec Gas Blender course teaches you to blend enriched
          air nitrox and helium-blend gases using one or more blending methods. Being the blender is a key
          job at a busy PADI Dive Center or Resort and your work allows other divers to do what they love to
          do – scuba dive.</div>

        <div class="column-3"><h3>Deep Speciality</h3>The lure of the deep. There’s something exciting and
          mysterious about exploring deeper dive sites while scuba diving. Sometimes it’s a wreck that attracts
          you below 18 metres/60 feet, and on wall dives it may be a giant fan or sponge. Whatever it is, to
          scuba dive with confidence at depths down to 40 metres/130 feet, you should take the PADI Deep Diver
          Specialty course.</div>

        <div class="column-3"><h3>Wreck Speciality</h3>Whether purpose-sunk as an artificial reef for scuba divers,
          or lost as the result of an accident, wrecks are fascinating windows to the past. Ships, airplanes and
          even cars are fascinating to explore and usually teem with aquatic life. Each wreck dive offers a chance
          for discovery, potentially unlocking a mystery or spying something others have missed. The PADI Wreck
          Diver Specialty course is popular because it offers rewarding adventures while observing responsible
          wreck diving practices.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column-3"><h3>Night Speciality</h3>The thought of dipping below the surface at night seems
          mysterious, yet so alluring. Although you’ve been scuba diving at a site many times before, at night
          you drop into a whole new world and watch it come to life under the glow of your dive light. The
          scene changes as day creatures retire and nocturnal organisms emerge. If you’ve wondered what happens
          underwater after the sun goes down, sign up for the PADI Night Diver Specialty course.</div>

        <div class="column-3"><h3>Search & Recovery Speciality</h3>It happens: People accidentally drop things
          from docks, off boats or even while scuba diving. If you’ve ever lost something in the water and wanted
          to go find it, then the PADI Search and Recovery Diver Specialty course is for you. There are effective
          ways to search for objects underwater that increase your chances of success. And there are good and
          better methods to bring up small, large or just awkward items. Search and recovery can be challenging,
          but a whole lot of fun.</div>

        <div class="column-3"><h3>Enriched Air EANx Speciality</h3>The PADI Enriched Air Diver course is PADI’s
          most popular specialty scuba course. Why? Because scuba diving with enriched air nitrox gives you more
          no decompression time, especially on repetitive scuba dives. If staying down longer and getting back
          in the water sooner sounds appealing, then don’t hesitate to become an enriched air diver.</div>

        <div class="column-2"><h3>Dive Master</h3>Love scuba diving? Want to share it with others on a whole new
          level? Take the PADI Divemaster course and do what you love to do as a career. Scuba divers look up
          to divemasters because they are leaders who mentor and motivate others. As a divemaster, you not only
          get to dive a lot, but also experience the joy of seeing others have as much fun diving as you do.
          <br><br>The PADI Divemaster course is your first level of professional training. Working closely with a
          PADI Instructor, you’ll fine-tune your dive skills, like perfecting the effortless hover, and refine
          your rescue skills so you anticipate and easily solve common problems. You’ll gain dive knowledge,
          management and supervision abilities so you become a role model to divers everywhere.
          <br><br>As a PADI Divemaster, you’ll lead others as you supervise scuba diving activities and assist with
          diver training. Whether you want to work at a faraway dive destination or close to home at a local dive
          shop, the adventure of a lifetime awaits you. PADI Divemasters are respected dive professionals who are
          aligned with the largest and most respected dive organization in the world – PADI. <h2>R14,000.00</h2></div>

        <div class="column-2"><h3>Instructor Development Course</h2>If you like people, have a passion for scuba
          diving and want an extraordinary life – become a PADI Instructor. Teaching scuba diving allows you to
          share your love of the aquatic world with others while doing what you enjoy – being in, around and under
          water. PADI Open Water Scuba Instructors and PADI Assistant Instructors are the most sought-after dive
          professionals around the world because they’ve completed the program that sets the standard for training
          dive professionals. You earn a PADI Instructor rating through hard work and commitment, but you’re rewarded
          with a job that lets you share incredible underwater adventures with others – transforming their lives for
          the better and enriching yours.
          <br><br>The Instructor Development Course (IDC) is made up of two parts – the Assistant Instructor (AI)
          course and the Open Water Scuba Instructor (OWSI) program. Most dive professionals complete the entire
          IDC and go on to attend an Instructor Examination (IE), which is the final step to earn a PADI Instructor
          certification.<br><br>Successfully completing just the AI course results in a PADI Assistant Instructor qualification.
          When an AI is ready to progress, attending an OWSI program allows entry into an IE to earn a full PADI
          Instructor rating.<br><br>Dive professionals who hold an instructor rating with another diver training
          organization may be eligible to enroll directly in the OWSI program. This recognizes prior instructor
          training and provides a path to become a PADI Instructor. <h3 id="left">Course fee (OWSI and EFRI): R16,500.00</h3>
